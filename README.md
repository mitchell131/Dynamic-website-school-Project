Task 1 Term 1
For Task 1 this must generally encompass a client side based site; in
other words it should show your ability to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is a prototype or mock-up of the site you will build in the next task.
There should be evidence that you can build with basic HTML, CSS.
It should also show some appropriate animation for the interface perhaps using Javascript and some evidence you can utilise forms and collect data.


Task 1 is generally completed around week 6, but check for announcements
on the exact date.
You should write this up in your blog as you develop.
You are allowed to host the work on a free website and post the URL on
on your blog.

Remember, it is the blog that is actually assessed!
Task 2 Term 1
Write a remote Web space management system suitable for handling Web site content of various types. It should allow a user to add and organise files to a personal Web area which is secured by password.
This program should include the following features.
(1) Your program should be written as PHP scripts . The user should be able to work with this program via a Web browser from any computer connected to the Internet.
(2) When your program starts, it should ask the user to enter a password and username, and not allow the user to access their Web space unless they know the password. Passwords should be stored in an appropriate MySQL database.
(3) Once allowed access the user should be able to:
(a) Make and delete directories
(b) Delete files
(c) Upload new files
(d) Only be able to access their own space, which should have space limits imposed upon it.

User data and passwords should be stored in an appropriate MySQL database or file system which the PHP script can access; you must consider security implications. There are no restrictions on the style of the user interface, although you should consider ease of use and design to be issues too.

Beyond the basic file management capabilities you could also consider adding the following:
• User preferences which alter the interface depending on who logs in.
• Auto-update of files so when a Website has been updated locally all new files can be uploaded.
• Support for mobile device (‘phone or PDA etc.)
